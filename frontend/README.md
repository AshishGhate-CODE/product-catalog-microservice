## API Integration

The frontend integrates with the following backend endpoints:

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user

### Product Endpoints
- `GET /products` - List products (with pagination, search, filters)
- `GET /products/{id}` - Get product details
- `POST /products` - Create product (Admin only)
- `PUT /products/{id}` - Update product (Admin only)
- `DELETE /products/{id}` - Delete product (Admin only)
- `GET /products/categories` - Get product categories

### Expected Backend Data Format

#### Product Object
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Product description",
  "price": 29.99,
  "category": "Electronics",
  "brand": "Brand Name",
  "stock": 100,
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

#### User Object
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "email": "user@example.com", 
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "USER" 
}
```

#### Auth Response
```json
{
  "token": "jwt_token_here", 
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe", 
    "role": "USER"
  }
}
```

## Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: User enters credentials ‚Üí Backend validates ‚Üí JWT token returned
2. **Token Storage**: Token stored in localStorage (recommend HttpOnly cookies for production)
3. **Request Interceptor**: Axios automatically adds Authorization header
4. **Route Protection**: ProtectedRoute component checks authentication status
5. **Auto Logout**: Token expiry triggers automatic logout

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: This demo uses localStorage for JWT tokens. For production, consider using HttpOnly cookies with refresh tokens for enhanced security.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Netlify/Vercel)

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy the dist/ folder to your preferred static hosting service
```

### Option 2: Docker Container

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Option 3: Platform as a Service

Deploy directly to platforms like Railway, Render, or Heroku using the provided configuration.

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test
